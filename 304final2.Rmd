## Abstract

In this article, we focus on the relationship between gasoline consumption per mile and a series of explanatory variables. First, we used the method of descriptive statistical analysis to gain a preliminary understanding of the data distribution, and then we established a multiple linear regression model. After hypothesis testing and statistical diagnosis, we found that the multiple linear regression model was significant. Finally, we gave some discussions on the practical significance of this model.

**Key words**: multi-linear regression, descriptive statistic, gasoline comsumption


## Introduction

COVID-19 ravaged the world in 2020, which affected the global stock market due to the long-lasting pandemic, most surprise for us is due to the OPEC meeting in March after the failure of negotiations, OPEC countries increased gasoline production caused by the meltdown of U.S. stocks, and compared with the new energy company that Tesla's stock price has soared this year, straight to $1,800 which is a high record. ^[1]^These show that gasoline has a huge impact on our economy, and investors have high expectations for new energy sources. In 2020, despite the global economic downturn caused by the pandemic, global car sales reached 5.55 million units in March. Also according to IHS, by 2030, the market share of global electric vehicle sales (including BEV electric, FC fuel cell and PHEV plug-in hybrids) will around 24.6%, while internal combustion engine vehicles, including hybrids, mild hybrids (which use high-capacity batteries to improve the efficiency of the internal combustion engine) and pure internal combustion engine power, the market share will be 75.4%. ^[2]^Overall, the automobile industry remains a great trend, and fuel-efficient vehicles will continue to dominate this industry.


When people think of gasoline, the word that come into their minds are often "politics", "industry", "chemicals" and so on. People rarely consider and analyze the statistics with gasoline. However, I think this will be the main purpose of this report. In this report, I will use a series of methods, such as descriptive statistical analysis, multi-linear regression, variable selection, etc. to create the model between gasoline consumption and the explanatory variables.

An official data set will be used to model the gasoline consumption and its explanatory variables. This data set contains multiple explanatory variables, which will help improve our fitting effect and persuasiveness. In the Methodology section, I will first briefly analyze the source of the data set and our focus, and then I will use descriptive statistical analysis to create multiple charts, and finally I will use multiple linear regression and variable selecting to perform statistical modeling with the diagnosis. Results of analysis are provided in the Results section. 


## Methodology

### Data 

The data used in this project comes from the StatLib library at Carnegie Mellon University. There is a total of 398 observations and eight observables, which are MPG (Miles Per gallon, continuous variable, the response variable of interest to this project), cylinders (number of car cylinders, discrete variable), displacement (engine displacement in cubic inches, continuous variable). horsepower (horsepower, continuous variable), weight (vehicle weight in pounds, continuous variable), acceleration (time from 0 to 60 mph in seconds, continuous variable), model_year (year the car was produced, discrete variable), origin (source of the car (1. US, 2. Europe, 3. Japan), discrete variables). Of interest to this project are the main factors that influence vehicle fuel consumption. Another consideration in the selection of this dataset for this project is that the dataset was generated in 1982, more than 40 years ago, and the data has been completely revised and the data has been properly recorded to ensure the reliability of the analysis results. In addition, although the automobile industry has changed dramatically during these 40 years, these changes are mainly in the areas of vehicle configuration, artificial intelligence and driverlessness. In other words, the characteristics recorded in this dataset are still applicable to current vehicles.

Before analyzing the data, the project provides a brief description of the data and thus a simple understanding of the data. The statistical results are shown in Table 1.

From the results of the descriptive statistics, it can be seen that the origin of the cars in this data is mainly from the United States, Europe and America, and Japan. Among them, US-made cars accounts for 62.50% of the US market, which indicates the strong industrial base of the US at that time. In addition, it can be seen from the data sheet that in terms of mpg (Miles per gallon), Japanese cars are the most superior, with the smallest standard deviation, which indicates that the mpg value is less dispersed, which is also the Japanese spirit of craftsmanship in pursuit of perfection. In terms of displacement, cars from the U.S. have the highest mpg, followed by those from Europe and the U.S., and Japan has the lowest mpg, reflecting the different regional cultures. This reflects the different cultures in different regions. The differences are due to cultural perceptions. For the variable Acceleration, the mean value is the lowest for American cars and the highest for Japanese cars, which means that American cars take the least time to accelerate, which is related to the displacement and the number of cylinders of the car. In addition, on the cylinder, the above table is the most common statistics of the number of cylinders. The number of cylinders in Japan and Europe is generally 4 cylinders, while the United States is 8, which is closely related to the engine capacity and horsepower.

Based on the above statistics, this project has gained some insight into the data, next, the project needs to conduct an exploratory analysis of the data. From Figure 1, it can be found that for displacement and horsepower, the effect on mpg (Miles per gallon) is the same, both show some positive correlation, and in addition, there are some differences in terms of combining origin, indicating that there is an interaction effect between these two variables and origin. In the case of weight, the larger the value, the smaller the mpg (Miles per gallon), indicating a negative correlation between them, while the interaction effect of origin is not very significant. For Acceleration, on the other hand, the correlation between them is found to be weak from Figure 1, although there is a positive correlation between them. For cylinders, on the other hand, the mpg values are higher at a level of 4 and lower at a level of 6, and the difference is large.

### Model

This project has provided some exploratory and analysis of the factors that affect mpg in the data set. Through this analysis and exploration, we have gained some understanding of the factors that affect mpg. Another variable in the dataset used in this project is the year of automobile production, which is described as a discrete variable in the official website. However, based on the knowledge of the automobile industry, its value may be related to some omitted variables, such as certain technologies and techniques of automobiles, pavement or other techniques used in automobiles, and the higher the value, the more advanced techniques and technologies are represented. Therefore, this variable is analyzed as a continuous variable in this project. From Figure 2, it can be seen that the value of mpg increases over time, which indicates that technological innovation improves Miles per gallon.

Here this project will be a modeling analysis using regression methods. With the previous analysis, we already have a good understanding of the data. Now we would like to use regression to analyze which factors affect the fuel consumption of a car(mpg). The reason is simple. first, the variable that we use as dependant variable is continuous, which means several methods such as softmax regression,logistic regression are not useful. what’s more, multi-linear regression model has the best explanatory power. we can easily find which predictor has the most important effect to the dependant variable. 

Before building the model, we first characterize the distribution of the response variable mpg, as shown in Figure 3, which presents a partial normal distribution. Here we plan to use ordinary linear regression to study the problem.

Here, I use all the data to build a model, the model form is 
$$
mpg=\beta_o+\beta_1 *cylinders + \beta_2 *displacement + \beta_3 *horsepower +\beta_4 * weight + \beta_5 *acceleration + \beta_6 *age of car + \beta_7 *origin. 
$$

## Results

Here, we build the final model, the model coefficient results are shown in table6. The F test value of the model is 198, the degrees of freedom are 12 and 379, and the p value is much less than 0, indicating that the model is successfully constructed and can be concentrated on the data The variation of mpg is explained. In addition, the adjusted R2 of the model is 0.8425, indicating that the model can explain the mpg variation by 84.25%. In addition, based on the model coefficients, it can be found that the t-tests for all coefficients are significant (except for acceleration). Furthermore, it can be found from the results that the average difference in mpg between 4 cylinders and 3 cylinders is 6.72, and the average difference of mpg between 5 cylinders and 3 cylinders is 7.08, and the average difference between 6 cylinders and 8 cylinders is very small. The coefficient value of displacement is 0.0187, indicating that when its value increases by one unit, mpg will increase by 0.0187 on average; horsepower coefficient is -0.0349, which implies that when the horsepower increases by one unit, mpg will decrease by 0.0349 on average; the weight coefficient is negative, indicating that it is negative with mpg Related, and when it increases by one unit, mgp will decrease by 0.00578 on average. The acceleration coefficient is 0.026, indicating that the less time required to drive to 60km/h, the greater the mpg value, but its t-test is not significant, indicating that it is not significant to the model. The contribution is not significant (the coefficient is 0). As for the variable age of car, we can understand it as cars produced in different years, which represent technological progress. From the results, we can understand that compared with the previous year, the mpg value increases by 0.737 as the cars are produced. In terms of cars from different origins, European-made cars will increase by 1.76 compared to U.S.-made cars, and Japanese-made cars will increase by 2.62 compared to the U.S.

In addition, in the project, we used discrete variables such as origin and cylinders. Therefore, our model can be decomposed into six models, as follows:

<img src="C:\Users\xyr22\Desktop\table3.png" alt="table6" style="zoom:70%;" />

Then, we constructed and selected the main factors in the model. Here I constructed the model based on the filtered factors and performed residual diagnosis. The upper left of Figure 4 is the residual test. From the figure, it can be found that there is no trend between the residual value and the fittings, and the mean value of the residual value is 0, indicating that the model meets the linear assumption and the zero mean assumption. The upper right is the normality test. The points in the figure are mostly distributed near the fitting straight line, indicating that the model meets the normality assumption. The lower left test is for homoscedasticity. The points in the graph do not exhibit volatility clustering, so we don't think it has heteroscedasticity. The bottom right is outlier detection. The dots in the figure indicate that there are some outliers, but based on the model, these values are outliers, and for the data, these values are not outliers. In order to make the model fit better, we can delete these values and refit. But overall, there are fewer outliers which can be ignored.

## Prediction

In this project, we are most concerned about which factors affect the fuel consumption of the car, and how to predict the fuel consumption of the model. Here we predict the fuel consumption based on the constructed model. The dots in the figure below represent the actual data, and the line represents the prediction. From the figure, we can find that the points are around the line, indicating that our prediction generally represents the average level of the corresponding group, which means that the model we built is effective and can simply predict the fuel consumption of the car.

## Discussion

### Summary

In this project, we use ordinary linear regression models to explore the factors that affect car fuel consumption and hope to build a model to predict car fuel consumption. In this model, we first perform simple statistics on the data, so as to have a simple understanding of the data. On this basis, we are all exploratory analysis to further understand the data. Then we use regression modeling analysis, through regression modeling, we have a general understanding of the influencing factors of mpg, through this model, we can see Cars of different countries and different cylinders are predicted. In addition, in order to increase the confidence in the model, we also conducted a residual test and found that the model is credible. 

### Conclusions

Based on the results, we found that cars with 6 cylinders have the minimum mpg which means it is the most fuel efficient. What’s more, cars produced in Europe nearly save 0.9 gallons of oil per mile. The continuous predictors such as horsepower, weight have negative effect on the mpg. In contrast, displacement, acceleration, age of year all have positive effect on the mpg. Due to all above. we suggest people choose cars produced in Europe, with 6 cylinders with high horsepower, weight as well as low displacement, acceleration, age of year in order to decrease mpg.

### Weakness & Next steps

Although we have used many statistical methods, these methods may seem a little inefficient. We have not used any modern statistical methods, which may reduce the scientific nature of the report. In addition, we have not used non-parametric statistical methods, and parametric statistical methods rely too much on the normality of the original data, which may not be satisfied in real life.

In addition, the interaction terms are not included in the final model due to the limited survey sample size and lack of professional knowledge. However, evidence can be seen from the exploratory plots that the interactions between the selected predictors are likely to be important (see Figure1 the trend of mpg on displacement and horsepower is similar which means high correlation). Obviously, in the next research, I will take more non-parametric methods to statistically model mpg, such as kernel regression. And I will consider interaction term.
